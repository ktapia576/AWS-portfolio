# 🚀 AWS Portfolio Website - Next.js, Tailwind CSS v4 & AWS Cloud Services

Welcome to my **AWS Portfolio Website** repository! This project serves as a learning exercise to explore AWS services, particularly **AWS CloudFront**, **Route 53**, and possibly **AWS Lambda**, while using **Next.js** and **React** to build a serverless and scalable portfolio website.

This project follows the **JAMStack architecture**, leveraging static site generation, serverless functions, and a CDN-first approach to ensure fast and efficient performance.
